## [Linear Regression and K-means Clustering With numpy](https://github.com/rluedde/ml_algorithms)
* Wrote these algorithms entirely from scratch
* Learned about n-dimensional space and matrix algebra/calculus
* Implemented gradient descent and differentiation as methods of regression paramater estimation
* Applied k-means to the infamous iris dataset with the intent of predicting the species clusters:

**Actual species grouping versus what K-means predicts:**

**Regression models on test data using each estimation type:**

## [Sorting Algorithm Visualizations](https://github.com/rluedde/algorithm_viz)
* **PROJECT IN PROGRESS!**
* Scraped data from 100 books (title/page length) with python's bs4 and requests libraries
* In the visualizer, each book is represented by a rectangle with length proportional to the
corresponding book's length
- [x] Scrape data
- [x] Get classes set up for indivudal Books
- [x] Build bubble sort algorithm to sort the books
- [ ] Add mouseover functionality - you mouse over a block and it shows you the title, author, and page
count
- [ ] Once the framework is stable, add other algorithms: quick sort, insertion sort, merge sort, etc.
- [ ] Get some gifs up on this website. That might not be possible but it'd sure be cool.


## [Sudoku Solver and Game](https://github.com/rluedde/sudoku)
* **PROJECT IN PROGRESS!**
* Implementing a backtracking algorithm to solve sudoku puzzles
* Creating a visualization of the backtracking algorithm
* Creating a simple UI so the game is playable
- [x] Build basic HTML/CSS GUI
- [X] Implement sudoku logic to where game is playable by a person
- [ ] Add backtracking algorithm to solve/create new boards

## [Currency Market Trading Algorithms](images/poster.pdf)
* Created sets of algorithmic rules to attempt to extract profit from currency markets
* Created ggplot2 visualizations of results
* Cleaned/transformed currency data
