## [Linear regression and k-means clustering with numpy](https://github.com/rluedde/ml_algorithms)
* Wrote these algorithms entirely from scratch
* Learned about n-dimensional space and matrix algebra/calculus
* Used map and reduce for increased code readability
* Implemented gradient descent and differentiation as methods of regression paramater estimation

**Actual species grouping versus what K-means predicts**

## [Sudoku solver/game](https://github.com/rluedde/sudoku)
* Implemented a backtracking algorithm to solve sudoku puzzles
* Created a visualization of the backtracking algorithm
* Created a simple UI so the game is playable as well

## [Currency market trading algorithms](images/poster.pdf)
* Created sets of algorithmic rules to attempt to extract profit from currency markets
* Created ggplot2 visualizations of results
* Cleaned/transformed currency data
